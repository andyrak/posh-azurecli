# posh-azurecli
Provides tab completion for [azure cli](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli/) commands in PowerShell

## Installation etc
Ensure that you have [chocoloatey](https://chocolatey.org/) installed.


To install milestone drops (note these are still 'pre-release'):

```
    choco install posh-azurecli -pre
```

There is also a [non-milestone feed](https://www.myget.org/F/posh-azurecli/api/v2) now up on MyGet. 
To install these interim drops use:

```
    choco install posh-azurecli -source 'https://www.myget.org/F/posh-azurecli/api/v2' -pre
```
